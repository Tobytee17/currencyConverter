# currencyConverter
currencyConverter is a currency conversion tool that pulls real-time exchange rates for 32 different currencies from the Fixer.io API (which are in tern provided by the European Central Bank). After doing research into the roles of REST API's in web-development, I decided that I wanted to create something that both utilized an API, and had real-world application. As a result, I decided to create this bare-bones currency conversion tool.

## Technology used
This project utilizes JavaScript, JQuery and Bootstrap. It is also powered by the [Fixer.io API](http://fixer.io/)
